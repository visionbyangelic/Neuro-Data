        "# 🧠 Hemispheric Lateralization: Mapping the Brain's \"Division of Labor\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🌟 Project Executive Summary (Non-Technical)\n",
        "Have you ever heard that some people are \"left-brained\" or \"right-brained\"? While that is a myth, it is true that our brains have a **Division of Labor**. For example, the left side usually handles language, while the right side is better at recognizing faces.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project uses advanced brain-recording technology (EEG) from **100 different people** to create a map of which side of the brain \"lights up\" during specific tasks. By measuring electrical brain waves, we can prove how specialized our hemispheres actually are.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🎯 Project Aim\n",
        "The goal is to quantify **Functional Lateralization**—the brain's tendency to prioritize one hemisphere over the other for specific cognitive skills. We are specifically looking for a \"mirrored effect\":\n",
        "1.  **Left Hemisphere Focus**: Active during language and word processing.\n",
        "2.  **Right Hemisphere Focus**: Active during face and spatial recognition.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🛠 The Technical Pipeline (For Data Scientists & Neuroscientists)\n",
        "This study utilizes the **OpenNeuro ds007172** dataset, a high-density 64-channel EEG collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. Cloud-to-Cloud Data Engineering\n",
        "To handle the ~12GB dataset efficiently under restricted local bandwidth, I implemented a **headless transfer pipeline**. Data was moved directly from Amazon S3 buckets to Google Drive using the AWS CLI within a Colab environment. This ensured zero local data consumption and high-speed acquisition.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Signal Processing & \"Alpha Asymmetry\"\n",
        "The primary metric used to determine brain activity is **Alpha Power Suppression (8–13 Hz)**.\n",
        "* **The Logic**: In EEG, an *active* brain region shows a *decrease* in Alpha power (known as Event-Related Desynchronization).\n",
        "* **The Feature Extraction**: For every participant, I isolated the 8–13 Hz frequency band and compared the energy in the **Left ROI** (odd-numbered electrodes) vs. the **Right ROI** (even-numbered electrodes).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. Mathematical Modeling: The Laterality Index (LI)\n",
        "To standardize the results across 100 subjects, I calculated a **Laterality Index** for each task:\n",
        "$$LI = \\frac{Power_{Left} - Power_{Right}}{Power_{Left} + Power_{Right}}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "* **A Positive LI** indicates the right side is more active (lower Alpha power).\n",
        "* **A Negative LI** indicates the left side is more active.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. Batch Processing at Scale\n",
        "I designed a **serial processing loop** that analyzes subjects individually. This allows the pipeline to process 100 people without exceeding the RAM limits of a standard cloud environment, generating a robust statistical average of human brain specialization.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 📊 Key Research Questions\n",
        "* Does \"Word\" processing show a consistent leftward shift across all 100 people?\n",
        "* Is \"Face\" recognition as strongly lateralized as language, or is it more distributed?\n",
        "* How does the \"Resting State\" compare to active tasks in terms of hemispheric balance?"

            "The dataset comprises 100 participants (53 females, 46 males, 1 diverse individual). 27 of the females were right-handed, the rest was non-right-hand dominant. Of the males 24 were right-handed, while the rest was non-right-hand dominant. The mean age of the participants was 25.6 [4.91SD] years. All participants reported normal or 2 corrected-to-normal vision, had no unilateral sensory or motor deficits, no history of mental illnesses 3 or neurologic disorders, and were currently not taking any medication.\n",
            "\n",
            "All participants started with a resting state (RS) of approximately eight minutes, where periods of open and closed eyes were included (each period was 63seconds, leading to 4.2 minutes of open eyes and 4.2 minutes of closed eyes resting state). After the RS each participant completed four tasks in a randomized order. Each task was constructed in the same way: The participants were instructed verbally as well as in written form directly before each trial 4 began. They were told to only react to the target stimuli (animal names, female faces, and houses with pitched roofs) via a press on the space bar. Each trial consisted of three blocks: one short practice block, one block where answers should be given with the right hand, and one block where answers should be given with the left hand. The starting hand was randomized across participants. During the trials, words (words task) or pictures (faces, emotions, and houses task) were shown in the center of the screen for one second, followed by a fixation cross for 500-700ms. After 80 stimuli, the response hand was changed, leading to a total of 160 stimuli presentations for each task. For more specific information look here: Reinke, P., Deneke, L., & Ocklenburg, S.
